     * This method performs row operations along a column of a matrix, starting at a specified row

     * 1) If a row element that is not "0" is found, firstNonzeroRow is set to false in order to 
     *    prevent further iterations of the for loop that searches for the first non zero row.
     * 2) The first non zero element in the column is scaled to 1 by scalar multiplication with its 
     *    reciprocal (if it is not already at 1).
     * 3) The first non zero row is swapped with the starting row to become the pivot row (if it is 
     *    not already at the starting row).
     * 4) The pivot row is scaled to the negative of all other non zero values in the column and 
     *    is then added to those rows until it is the only non zero value remaining in that column.
     *    
     * - If no non zero value is found from the starting row index to the end of the column, then 
     *   the method returns null to indicate that no row operations took place.
     *       
     * - If steps is true, every elementary row operation performed during the row reduction 
     *   process will be described and output to the user.
